# CPP
42 Milestones 4 &amp; 5


The CPP modules are a series of simple exercises that serve as an introduction to both the c++ language and oop as a whole. There are nine modules, each focusing on different parts of c++.



### CPP 00
An introduction of how c++ works. Contains:
- ex 00: Megaphone
```
	Make a to_upper function using c++ logic
```
- ex 01: Phonebook
```
	Make two classes, a phonebook and its contacts. Use functions to set and get contact info within the phonebook
```
- ex 02: AccLogs
```
	Figure out a .cpp file from a .hpp file, a main and the program's outout.
```



### CPP 01
Some new c++ characteristics. Contains:
- ex 00: BraiiiiiiinnnzzzZ
```
	Differentiating between creating objects in the heap and creating objects in the stack
```
- ex 01: Moar brainz!
```
	Allocating a whole array in a single line and passing different attributes to its members
```
- ex 02: HI THIS IS BRAIN
```
	A simple debugging to see the difference between pointers and references
```
- ex 03: Unnecessary violence
```
	Seeing how to use references and pointers with class attributes
```
- ex 04: Sed is for losers
```
	Recreating a replace() function to see how ifstream and ofstream work
```
- ex 05: Harl 2.0
```
	An introduction to error level management and pointer to functions	
```
- ex 06: Harl filter
```
	An introduction to switch cases and cascades
```



### CPP 02
The orthodox canonical form and fixed points. Contains:
- ex 00: My First Class in Orthodox Canonical Form
```
	Create a fixed-point class that complies with the orthodox canonical form
```
- ex 01: Towards a more useful fixed-point number class
```
	Make the fixed-point class more useful by adding int and float converters
```
- ex 02: Now we’re talking
```
	Including overloading operators to the fixed-point class
```
- ex 03: BSP
```
	A little exercise using fixed-points to guess if a certain point is inside a triangle
```



### CPP 03
Classes and inheritance. Contains:
- ex 00: Aaaaand... OPEN!
```
	Create a class with some private attributes and unique functions
```
- ex 01: Serena, my love!
```
	Make a child of the previous class changing some functions' behaviour
```
- ex 02:  Repetitive work
```
	Make a second different child that comes from the same parent and changes behaviours to different ones
```
- ex 03: Now it’s weird!
```
	Make a grandchild using diamond inheritance, using both of the previous children as parents
```
