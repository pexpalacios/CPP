# CPP
42 Milestones 4 &amp; 5


The CPP modules are a series of simple exercises that serve as an introduction to both the c++ language and oop as a whole. There are nine modules, each focusing on different parts of c++.

Milestone 4: [CPP 00](#cpp-00)   [CPP 01](#cpp-01)   [CPP 02](#cpp-02)   [CPP 03](#cpp-03)   [CPP 04](#cpp-04)

Milestone 5: [CPP 05](#cpp-05)   [CPP 06](#cpp-06)   [CPP 07](#cpp-07)   [CPP 08](#cpp-08)   [CPP 09](#cpp-09)

```
	Allocating a whole array in a single line and passing different attributes to its members
```
- ex 02: HI THIS IS BRAIN
```
	A simple debugging to see the difference between pointers and references
```
- ex 03: Unnecessary violence
```
	Seeing how to use references and pointers with class attributes

### CPP 02
The orthodox canonical form and fixed points. Contains:
- ex 00: My First Class in Orthodox Canonical Form
```
	Create a fixed-point class that complies with the orthodox canonical form
```
- ex 01: Towards a more useful fixed-point number class
```
	Make the fixed-point class more useful by adding int and float converters
```
- ex 02: Now we’re talking
```
	Including overloading operators to the fixed-point class
```

```

---

### CPP 03
Classes and inheritance. Contains:
- ex 00: Aaaaand... OPEN!
```

```
- ex 01: Serena, my love!
```
	Make a child of the previous class changing some functions' behaviour
```
- ex 02:  Repetitive work
```
	Make a second different child that comes from the same parent and changes behaviours to different ones
```
- ex 03: Now it’s weird!
```
	Make a grandchild using diamond inheritance, using both of the previous children as parents
```

### CPP 04
A bit more inheritance, now with abstract classes and interfaces. Contains:
- ex 00: Polymorphism
```
  Create an animal class and its children cat and dog. All must have different types and make different sounds.

- ex 01:  I don’t want to set the world on fire
```
  Add a pruvate array of a new class called brain in cat and dog.
```
- ex 02: Abstract class
```
  Make animal an abstract class  
```
- ex 03: Interface & recap
```
  A rather confusing exercise to learn about the differences between abstract classes and interfaces
```

---

### CPP 05
Exceptions, not much else new. Contains:
- ex 00: Mommy, when I grow up, I want to be a bureaucrat!
```
	An introduction to exceptions using the class bureaucrat
